### Image-Classification

Image Classification done via pretrained models like InceptionNet and ResNet18,using Gradio framework.

1. Inception Net image classifier, which we'll load using Tensorflow! Since this is an image classification model, we will use the Image input interface. We'll output a dictionary of labels and their corresponding confidence scores with the Label output interface.

2.Similarly we use ResNet18 to test the same image.
